# UrConfig
## Generic configuration file format based on Unreal Engine .ini file format

Stores key-value pairs under sections as plaintext. Files are easy to modify by hand, and since there is no mandated type system, are language agnostic.

* See spec.txt for a specification.
* See LICENSE for license terms.
* See test.ufg for a sample configuration file.
